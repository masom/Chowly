<h2>About Chowly</h2>
	<p>Chowly.com offers a variety of daily deals on handpicked restaurants. By working with local restaurants,
	Chowly is able to sell off tables that would otherwise go unused at great discounts. Our mission is
	to provide the most comprehensive restaurant deal site available online. Unlike group buying sites,
	Chowly works with the restaurants to create a predictable and reliable stream of new and returning
	customer’s month over month. This means that at no point does the restaurant get overwhelmed with
	an unexpected rush of coupon redemption.</p>
	
	<p>Bottom line to a Chowly.com member; the best selection and consistency of restaurant deals available
	anywhere at the best price. Use Chowly for:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Last minute hunger attacks</li>
		<li>Group night outs with family or friends</li>
		<li>A quick meal while watching the game</li>
		<li>Date night out</li>
		<li>A great gift</li>
		<li>You tell <?=$this->html->link('us!', array('Tickets::add', 'args'=>'comments'));?></li>
