<p>Chowly will contact you by email once our website is launched and we are ready to provide our beta users with the best local restaurant deals available.</p>
<p>By providing your postal code to Chowly you are helping us determine what restaurants to approach for the beta release.</p>
<p>Chowly will never use this information for solicitation, nor will we sell or rent this list to others. We do not sell information about you to any third party and we do not share it with third parties unless it is necessary to complete a request you have made, process a transaction for you, or to comply with the law.</p>
